Problem Description

   - Scenario: Five philosophers are sitting at a round table. Each philosopher alternates between two activities:
        Thinking (does not need resources).
        Eating (requires two forks, one on each side).

   - There are five forks, one between each pair of philosophers.

   - A philosopher can eat only if they can pick up both forks simultaneously.



Solution:
    Key Points of the Solution

        Prevent Deadlock:
            Limit the number of philosophers who can attempt to pick up forks to NUM_PHILOSOPHERS - 1. This ensures at least one philosopher can eat, breaking circular wait.

        Mutual Exclusion:
            Use semaphores for each fork to ensure only one philosopher can use it at a time.

        Avoid Starvation:
            Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, ensuring fairness.

        Concurrency:
            Multiple philosophers can think or eat simultaneously if forks are available.



Common Variations

    Chandy-Misra Solution: Uses messages and tokens to manage resource allocation.
    Asymmetrical Solution: Philosophers alternate fork-picking order (left-first for odd IDs, right-first for even IDs) to avoid deadlock
